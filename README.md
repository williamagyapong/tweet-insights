***The goal is to provide a free online platform for users to be able to
effortlessly draw insteresting and valuable insights from the data
generated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)…***

> We come your way with a tool for understanding tweeting patterns or
> trends, discovering frequently used words, detecting emotions and
> sentiments expressed in tweets, and many more. For instance, from the
> home page you would find that Former President Obama’s 2014 - 2020
> tweets are seen to be **highly positive**, full of **trust**, quite
> **joyful** and **fearful**, and with great **anticipation**. Moreover,
> the Former President appeared to have tweeted a lot about the
> **climate**, **people**, and the **pandemic**, which tells us how
> concerning or important these topics were to him in general.

No more talks, just see the [Tweet
Insights](https://william-agyapong.shinyapps.io/tweet-insights/?_ga=2.230265368.589920579.1646163786-1638345359.1645640858)
app for yourself\!

  - If you did try the link to the app you’ll see that the game has just
    started: The app is in its early stage of development.
  - This app is fed with data obtained directly from Twitter with the
    help of the Twitter REST API via the
    [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) package.
  - Currently, the app features the tweets from a preprocessed data for
    a single twitter user account.
  - But the ultimate aim is to make the app more dynamic by allowing
    users to view information about different user accounts on the fly.
  - The home page is meant to provide a general overview about the
    content served on the app and other information deemed necessary.
  - Thematic contents will be delivered under various taps as seen.
