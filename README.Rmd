***The goal is to provide a free online platform for users to be able to effortlessly draw insteresting and valuable insights from the data generated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)...***

>We come your way with a tool for understanding tweeting patterns or trends, discovering frequently used words, detecting emotions and sentiments expressed in tweets, and many more. For instance, from the home page you would find that Former President Obamaâ€™s 2014 - 2020 tweets are seen to be **highly positive**, full of **trust**, quite **joyful** and **fearful**, and with great **anticipation**. Moreover, the Former President appeared to have tweeted a lot about the **climate**, **people**, and the **pandemic**, which tells us how concerning or important these topics were to him in general.

No more talks, just see the [Tweet Insights](https://william-agyapong.shinyapps.io/tweet-insights/?_ga=2.230265368.589920579.1646163786-1638345359.1645640858) app for yourself!


- If you did try the link to the app you'll see that the game has just started: The app is in its early stage of development.
- This app is fed with data obtained directly from Twitter with the help of the Twitter REST API via the [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) package.
- Currently, the app features the tweets from a preprocessed data for a single twitter user account.
- But the ultimate aim is to make the app more dynamic by allowing users to view information about different user accounts on the fly.
- The home page is meant to provide a general overview about the content served on the app and other information deemed necessary.
- Thematic contents will be delivered under various taps as seen.
